This repo contains image quality assesment model, that I've done as a part of pipeline model of self-checkout model. 


### Working with repo

1.	Clone this repo
2.	Download [train data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/170FK3Ji1fy0TvJZreAKzGL0Y91fjUxa7?usp=sharing), [test data]() and put in local repo with appropriate relative paths 

	Path to train images "/regression_task/data"

	Path to test images "/data/test_images"
3. Everything is ready for your experiments. Run train_reg.ipynb, train models and see the results.	
Path to train data "/regression_task/data"
Path to initial images "/data/initial_images"
